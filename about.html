                    <p> I don't have as much programming experience as some other developers out there, but I am eager to learn and willing to work hard to improve. My education has been a combination of teaching myself and going to school. I have learned
                        more from personal projects than I have ever learned from school, not to mention how much more enjoyable it is to work on something that I am passionate about. I am a self-motivated individual and think that I can offer a lot to
                        any company willing to hire me. What I lack in experience I make up for with my work ethic and a willingness to learn. Looking through my projects you might notice that there are a fair amount of video games. This is mostly because
                        I find making video games to be a very enjoyable and rewarding experience. Since I was young, I have enjoyed video games. This eventually led to a passion for making them. For the past couple of years, I have taught myself how
                        to make video games, mostly using the Unity game engine, though I have also used OpenGL (GLUT). One of the first projects that I ever finished was a game I made in a weekend that I eventually put on the Google Play store. The game,
                        "Cal-Transmission," has a page of this website dedicated to it. The game is very simple, but the experience taught me a lot and only motivated me to make more games. I am currently working on a 2D platformer that is much more involved
                        than Cal-Transmission. The game doesn't have a name yet, but the working title is "Raccoon Game." The game is my attempt at telling a story, though it is currently in the early stages of development, I think it shows my passion
                        for software development. If you are interested, there are more details about the games on their pages.</p>
                    <p> While video games are my primary passion when it comes to software development, I find many other subjects interesting and I am more than willing to learn something less familiar. I have taught myself some web development in an attempt
                        to satisfy my curiosity(HTML, CSS, JS). Through school, I have become familiar with c++ and somewhat c and python. Along with videogames being fun to make, they have also taught me a lot about how to utilize OOP practices. Through
                        my formal education, I have also been introduced to algorithms, data structures, calculus, linear algebra, and statistics.</p>
                    <p>All in, I think that I would be a valuable addition to any development team. I am relatively new to the industry, but everyone has to start somewhere and I am hard-working and willing to learn. If you think I would be a good fit with
                        your team, my email is listed at the bottom of every page and I check it regularly.</p>
