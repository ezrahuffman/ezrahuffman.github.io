                    <p> I am a passionate game developer, though I do not limit myself exclusively to games. My education has been a combination of on-the-job experience through internships, teaching myself, and studying computer science at school. I have
                        learned more from personal projects than I have learned from school, not to mention how much more enjoyable it is to work on something that I am passionate about. I am a self-motivated individual with over a year of experience
                        working remotely as a software developer at NASA. I have had a fair amount of experience as an intern at NASA and while I enjoyed my time there, I am looking to take the next step in my career. Looking through my projects you might
                        notice that there are a fair amount of video games. This is mostly because I find making video games to be a very enjoyable and rewarding experience. Since I was young, I have enjoyed playing video games. This eventually led to
                        a passion for making them. For the past few years, I have taught myself how to make video games, mostly using the Unity game engine, though I have also used OpenGL(GLUT) and Unreal. One of the first projects that I ever finished
                        was a game I made in a weekend that I eventually put on the Google Play store. The game, "Cal-Transmission," has a page of this website dedicated to it. The game is very simple, but the experience taught me a lot and only motivated
                        me to make more games. I am currently working on a 2D platformer that is much more involved than Cal-Transmission. The game doesn't have a name yet, but the working title is "The Cave Game." The game is a casual exploration game,
                        where the player must navigate their way through caverns while fighting off enemies avoiding traps. The levels in the game are also programmatically generated and do not require any fine-tuning, meaning it is easy to make an enormous
                        amount of levels. I plan on giving the player some control of this feature with plans for an "infinite" arcade mode. If you are interested, there are more details about the games on their pages.</p>
                    <p>While video games are my primary passion when it comes to software development, I find many other subjects interesting and I am more than willing to learn something less familiar. I have taught myself some web development in an attempt
                        to satisfy my curiosity(HTML, CSS, JS). Through school, I have become familiar with C++, C, Java, and Python. Along with video games being fun to make, they have also taught me a lot about how to utilize OOP practices and design
                        patterns. Through my formal education, I have also been introduced to algorithms, data structures, calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, probability, physics (I am minoring, so a lot), and computer organization (assembly/machine
                        and some hardware).</p>
                    <p>All in, I think that I would be a valuable addition to any development team. I am relatively new to the industry, but everyone has to start somewhere and I am hard-working and willing to learn. If you think I would be a good fit with
                        your team, my email is listed at the bottom of every page and I check it regularly.</p>
