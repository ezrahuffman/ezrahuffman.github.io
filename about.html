                    <p>I am a passionate game developer with a year and a half of professional experience 
                        in gaming and streaming services/devices (I have 3 years of experience if you count the internships I did at NASA). 
                        I have gained hands-on experience working with Unreal Engine, C++, and blueprints as a Game Programmer at Game Sim for 8 months. 
                        In addition, I have worked for Amazon where I contributed to streaming services and devices using Linux, AWS, Continuous Development/Integration, 
                        Typescript, React Native, and Git. I am self-motivated, having worked remotely for almost three years including a year as a software developer intern 
                        at NASA. While I have enjoyed my time at Amazon, my desire to remain remote as the company returns to in-person operations has prompted me to look for
                         new opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p>My education includes studying computer science, but I have learned much more from personal 
                        projects, including developing video games using Unity, Unreal, and OpenGL (GLUT). 
                        Before I started working as a software developer, I was making my own games and learning along the way.
                         Throughout my professional career, I have continued to make my own games, applying what I learn to my professional projects as well.
                          Most of the games that I have made in my own time are small projects where I just wanted to make a game that I thought was a cool idea or to learn something new,
                           without any intentions of going to market or achieving commercial success. One of the first games I ever made was called “Cal-Transmission.” 
                           I did all of the programming for the game in about 16hrs with another person doing the art and sound. The game is not a technical marvel or even very novel, 
                           but it was a great learning experience going from scratch to putting the game on the google play store in such a short amount of time. I am also proud to have
                            recently updated and remade the "Cal-Transmission" game, which is now available on the Apple App Store. A more involved project is a 2D platformer called "The Cave Game,"
                             which involves casual exploration, combat, and procedurally generated levels. This game involved making tools for level generation, memory management
                              (the levels are very large), and many other more involved mechanics that were not present in some of my smaller personal projects. In addition to working on
                               a multi-player shooter professionally (during my time at game sim), I also have made some projects to learn about multiplayer in my own time. 
                               One such project was the modification of the Boss Room sample project from Unity. As a learning experience in server-authoritative architectures and 
                               Unity’s tools for networking (net code for game objects, lobby, relay, etc…) I turned the point-and-click co-op game into a PvP fighting game. 
                               I am always working on new projects and a game right now that is larger scale, so check the Games page of this website to learn more and keep up to date.</p>
                    <p>While video games are my primary passion 
                        when it comes to software development, I find many other subjects interesting and I am more than willing to learn something less familiar. 
                        I have professional experience working on large-scale, distributed systems at Amazon. While there I learned a lot about CI/CD and agile practices; 
                        as well as learning more about the Linux operating system, streaming services, and app development using React Native and TypeScript. In addition 
                        to my professional experience, I have taught myself some web development in an attempt to satisfy my curiosity(HTML, CSS, JS). Through school, 
                        I have become familiar with Assembly (Arm/MIPS), C, Java, and Python. Along with video games being fun to make, they have also taught me a lot about
                         how to utilize OOP practices, memory management, and design patterns. Through my formal education, I have also been introduced to algorithms, 
                         data structures, calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, probability, physics(also an area of personal interest to me), and computer organization.
                    </p>
                    <p>In all, I think that I would be a valuable addition to any development team. In addition to my existing experience, I am always eager to learn and like
                         to think that I work well both individually and as a member of a team.
                         If you think I would be a good fit with your team, my email and LinkedIn are listed at the bottom of every page and I check them regularly.
